<ul>
<li>Jekyll's most powerful (and simplest) feature is called "layouts"</li>
<li>A layout is simply a predefined HTML (or anything really) template which helps Jekyll render content more beautifullyer</li>
<li>Layouts live in the <code>_layouts</code> folder (you may have to create this initially)</li>
<li>When the layout is processed, the keyword <Br /><code>&#123;{ content }}</code> is replaced with the file's content</li>
</ul>
